Offline Voice Input is a privacy-focused, fully offline speech-to-text keyboard for Android.

It uses the NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B model (quantized to INT8) running locally on your device via ONNX Runtime — no internet connection required, no data leaves your phone.

Features:
• Fully offline — works without internet
• Privacy-first — all processing happens on-device
• IME keyboard with voice input
• Live subtitles via screen audio capture
• High accuracy with NVIDIA Parakeet TDT model
• Open source (MIT License)

The app downloads the AI model (~670 MB) on first launch. After that, everything runs entirely on your device.
